# Customer Segmentation with K-Means and PCA

## Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can help businesses understand their audience better and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Techniques Used
- **K-Means Clustering**: A popular unsupervised learning algorithm for grouping similar customers.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Used to reduce dimensionality while retaining essential variance in the data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling data, and preparing it for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Cluster representation using 2D and 3D plots to interpret the results effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of customer-related features such as age, income, spending habits, and other key attributes. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps ensure high-quality input for clustering.

## Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, standardizing data, and preparing it for clustering.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Reducing high-dimensional data while preserving patterns.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: Identifying customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
4. **Evaluation & Visualization**: Using Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and PCA visualizations to validate clusters.

## Results
- The project successfully grouped customers into distinct segments.
- PCA helped in visualizing the clusters effectively.
- Insights from segmentation can be used for personalized marketing strategies.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering.
- Integrate customer demographics for more refined segmentation.
- Apply deep learning techniques for advanced segmentation.
